      Today was a glorious day for a well-muscled Tazy Tarkhan!
      He led his brother Turkhan in the hunt. Over the course of 3 days hunting, He nabbed 5 rabbits, 2 foxes, and <strong>1 wolf</strong>! Wow! Incredible! In contrast, poor Turkhan just nabbed 3 rabbits and 1 fox. Still, Turkhan his brother was <em>vital</em> in bringing down the wolf together. Go go Tazy greyhound teamwork!
