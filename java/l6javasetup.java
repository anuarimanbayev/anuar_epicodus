Java setup
So far, we have been using the javaREPL to do all of our coding exercises in. To write our own Java programs, we'll need to install Java.
To start, download and install the Java SDK (Standard Edition Development Kit).
Next, download and install the Java JRE (Runtime Environment).
To make sure everything is installed correctly, run $ java -version. You should get something like (version numbers do not need to be the same):
java version "1.8.0_51"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_51-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.51-b02, mixed mode)
