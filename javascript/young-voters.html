        <h1>Voting Process Information for Young Voters</h1>

        <h2>Why Youth Voting Matters</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Voting is habit-forming:</strong> when young people learn the voting process and vote they are more likely to do so when they are older. If individuals have been motivated to get to the polls once, they are more likely to return. So, getting young people to vote early could be key to raising a new generation of voters.</li>
          <li><strong>Young people are a major subset of the electorate and their voices matter:</strong>strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                46 million young people ages 18-29 years old are eligible to vote, while 39 million seniors are eligible to vote
              </li>
              <li>
                Young people (18-29) make up 21% of the voting eligible population in the U.S.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Young people participation can influence election results</strong></li>
          <li>
            Involving young people in election-related learning, activities and discussion can have an <strong>impact on the young person household</strong>, increasing the likelihood that others in the household will vote. In immigrant communities, young voters may be easier to reach, are more likely to speak English (cutting down translation costs), and may be the most effective messengers within their communities.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">
          And there are <strong>major differences in voter turnout amongst youth subgroups, which may persist as these youth get older if the gaps are not reduced.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>What Works in Getting Youth to Vote</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Registration</strong> is sometimes a larger hurdle than the act of voting itself. Thus showing young people where to get reliable information on registration is helpful.</li>
          <li><strong>Personalized and interactive contact counts.</strong> The most effective way of getting a new voter is the in-person door-knock by a peer; the least effective is an automated phone call.
            <ul>
              <li>
                The medium is more important than the message. Partisan and nonpartisan, negative and positive messages seem to work about the same. The important factor is the degree to which the contact is personalized.
              </li>
              <li>
                Canvassing costs $11 to $14 per new vote, followed closely by phone banks at $10 to $25 per new vote. Robocalls mobilize so few voters that they cost $275 per new vote. (These costs are figured per vote that would not be cast without the mobilizing effort).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Begin with the basics: information.</strong> Telling a new voter where to vote, when to vote and how to use the voting machines increases turnout.</li>
          <li><strong>Talk to them!</strong> Leaving young voters off contact lists is a costly mistake. Some campaigns still bypass young voters, but research shows they respond cost-effectively when contacted.</li>
