          <h3>Age of Empires II</h3>

          <p>Jie and I were the Rushers Team and we finally beat the Turtlers Team of Sheng and Michael. The Turtlers usually chose economy-centric civilizations like the Persians, Byzantines, or Chinese and then just swarmed Jie and I in late game with masses of cheap Pikemen and Skirmisher units. However, Jie and I mastered the CRUSH, Castle Age rush, by placing our castles RIGHT between the Turtlers' gold trade caravan path and pushing ahead aggressively with Knights and Battering Rams. Ultimately, after many defeats, Jie and I polished the Rushing strategy to work regardless of civilization, but best works with cavalry/Knight-centric civs like the Franks or Huns.</p>

          <p>Jie as Chinese and Adam as Ottomans paired up twice against me as the Sioux. I beat them both, first with a cavalry-based army of Rifle Riders, and then second time with only infantry such as the Wahkeena Riflemen.</p>

          <p>Jie, Sheng, Sean, and I played 4v4 online. I was usually the most slowest APM player in Starcraft II, dragging my team somewhat, but still very very fun and engaging. Some really great games!</p>

          <p>Jie, Sheng, and I levelled an Arena team of a Discipline Priest(me), Feral Druid(Jie), and Frost Mage(Sheng). Discolol and Frostlol and Kittylol were fun trio. For some reason, I just remember running together around Ghostlands, lvl20 Blood Elven zone, hahaha</p>
